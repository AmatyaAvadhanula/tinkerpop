= TinkerPop Future

This document offers a rough view at what features can be expected from future releases and catalogs proposals for
changes that might be better written and understood in a document form as opposed to a dev list post.

This document is meant to change and restructure frequently and should serve more as a guide rather than directions set
in stone. As this document represents a future look, the current version is always on the `master` branch and therefore
the only one that need be maintained.

== Roadmap

image:gremlin-explorer-old-photo.png[width=250,float=left]This section provides some expectations as to what features
might be provided in future link:https://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/x.y.z/dev/developer/#_versioning[major versions]. It
is not a guarantee of a feature landing in a particular version, but it yields some sense of what core developers have
some focus on. The most up-to-date version of this document will always be in the
link:https://github.com/apache/tinkerpop/blob/master/docs/src/dev/developer/index.asciidoc[git repository].

The sub-sections that follow only outline those release lines that expect to include significant new features. Other
release lines may continue to be active with maintenance work and bug fixes, but won't be listed here.

=== 3.5.x

This initial release of this line was produced in May 2021.

* Support for bytecode based sessions with `tx()` for Python and .NET.

=== 3.6.x

The development of the 3.6.x release line is currently under way.

* Unify the Gremlin testing model by providing support for the Gherkin tests in Java so that they can be used by
providers to validate their implementations.

=== 3.7.x

Development has not yet started on the 3.7.x release line.

== Proposals

This section tracks and details future ideas. While the dev list is the primary place to talk about new ideas, complex
topics can be initiated from and/or promoted to this space. While it is fine to include smaller bits of content directly
in `future/index.asciidoc`, longer, more developed proposals and ideas would be better added as individual asciidoc
files which would then be included in the `index.asciidoc` (i.e. `include::good-idea.asciidoc[]`).

== Appendix

=== 4.x Branching Methodology

Development of 4.x occurs on the `4.0-dev` branch. This branch was created as an orphan branch and therefore has no
history tied to any other branch in the repo including master. As such, there is no need to merge/rebase `4.0-dev`. When
it comes time to promote `4.0-dev` to `master` the procedure for doing so will be to:

1. Create a `3.x-master` branch from `master`
1. Delete all content from `master` in one commit
1. Rebase `4.0-dev` on `master`
1. Merge `4.0-dev` to `master` and push

From this point 3.x development will occur on `3.x-master` and 4.x development occurs on `master` (with the same version
branching as we have now, e.g `3.3-dev`, `4.1-dev`, etc.) The `3.x-master` branch changes will likely still merge to
`master`, but will all merge as no-op changes.
